          honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might
          result in worse audio quality), unless the specified sample rate is not
          supported for the encoding chosen, in which case it will fail the request

          native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and
          0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any
          other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error.

      volumeGainDb:

          Optional volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the
          specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of
          0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB)
          will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal
          amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the
          amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. Strongly recommend not to
          exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for
          any value greater than that.

          [BCP-47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag, e.g.
          "en-US". Required. This should not include a script tag (e.g. use
          "cmn-cn" rather than "cmn-Hant-cn"), because the script will be inferred
          from the input provided in the SynthesisInput.  The TTS service
          will use this parameter to help choose an appropriate voice.  Note that
          the TTS service may choose a voice with a slightly different language code
          than the one selected; it may substitute a different region
          (e.g. using en-US rather than en-CA if there isn't a Canadian voice
          available), or even a different language, e.g. using "nb" (Norwegian

          voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should
          substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.
